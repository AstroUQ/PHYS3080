# PHYS3080 Cosmology Projects

Materials for the PHYS3080/7080 Cosmology Project at the University of Queensland.

These materials will evolve as the project proceeds (don't want to give away too many spoliers immediately!)

## Overview

Welcome to your next project in Astrophysics III at the University of Queensland. 

Here you'll be learning how to calculate important aspects of the expansion of the universe, cosmological distances, and cosmological horizons.

Start by downloading the pdf with the instructions from the menus on the left. 

Then look at the example code, available from the menus on the left or download the jupyter notebooks from [https://github.com/AstroUQ/PHYS3080_2022/tree/main/cosmo/docs/notebooks](https://github.com/AstroUQ/PHYS3080_2022/tree/main/cosmo/docs/notebooks)

Have fun!
